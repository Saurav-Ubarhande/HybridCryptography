# HybridCryptography
The primary aim is to build a system through which users can Login/Register on the platform and only authorised users have access to the website. These users can upload their files on the server which will be stored using multiple encryption algorithms and the key will be mailed to the user. And decryption of the files can be done using that Key only.
